## Hack-A-Thon Competition Overview

[IATR](http://iatr.global) hosts the **IATR 2019 Smart City Mobility Hack-A-thon** in conjunction with the [32nd IATR Annual Conference](http://iatr.global/iatr-conferences). 

The International Association of Transportation Regulators (IATR), along with its university partners and government regulator member agencies and related agencies and organizations, is conducting a “Smart City” Hack-A-Thon from **April 12-18th, 2019**.  

This competition seeks solutions for the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, by using data sets provided to suggest innovative ideas and policies (based on best practices or benchmarking) to enhance service to users in both urban and rural environments, while promoting and ensuring safety, accessibility/equity, environmental and fiscal responsibility goals.

The IATR’s “Data Commons,” housed at the University of California at Berkeley, is a repository for public and private transportation related data, and will be made available to participants to explore innovative solutions, including technology based initiatives, government policy recommendations, and/or service delivery improvements that can be implemented in the private and/or public sector, or through public/private partnerships.

The 2019 IATR Hack-A-Thon will include a *cash prize*, for students, in the amount of **$2,500 - $5,000 U.S. dollars**, within the sole discretion of the IATR.  The IATR, upon adxvice from its panel of participating judges, may elect to award or not award cash or other prizes, within its discretion, based upon the quality and innovative nature of the submissions.  In order to receive the prize, the competition winner, or finalists, must attend the IATR conference in Calgary on a date to be determined (either September 23rd or 24th, 2019), at the expense of the IATR.  The number of attendees from the winner or finalists shall be chosen by the IATR, in its sole discretion (usually one person per team).  Peer recognition, awards and possible job or internship opportunities may also be offered, within the sole discretion of the IATR and its participating sponsors.  The amount of the prize will only be available to teams that include one or more students, and may include or be supervised by faculty as well.  The amount of any potential prize may be awarded to the entire team or individuals within the discretion of the IATR.  Private sector competitors (teams that include start-ups, private businesses, or other entities not solely comprised of students or faculty), shall NOT be eligible for cash prizes – but instead will be eligible for discounted or free sponsorship or exhibition space at the 2019 IATR conference, within the sole discretion of the IATR. 


## How & Where to Compete?

Since this is a remote competition, participants can compete from their desired locations, such as their universities, offices, or their apartments, during the same dates and times, with submissions through an electronic portal. Finalists will be selected by a panel of IATR selected judges, and - within the discretion of the panel - may be required to answer written questions, deliver a remote presentation and/or to be interviewed.

Competitors can include students, professors, private companies, non-profit interest groups, government employees, or any person, team or institution which seeks to analyze available mobility data to present solutions to help the host city of the IATR's 32nd Annual Conference - namely Calgary. 

## Hack-A-Thon Challenge Topics

The following are questions or challenge opportunities that the IATR has identified for participants to address. However, this is a merely a list of suggestions. Competitors DO NOT need to focus on all or any of these topics, but can instead choose a topic that addresses the improvement of transportation service delivery in terms of safety, sustainability (traffic congestion and carbon footprint mitigation), fiscal efficiency, equity (accessibility, underserved and unbanked communities), or an overall Smart City plan, leveraging new and existing technology and relevant data to propose solutions on a narrow topic (see below) or a broader plan. Topics could include one or more of the following:   

1. How can Calgary implement an innovative parking and curb space solution?
2. Create a proposal to reduce traffic congestion (and/or the carbon footprint) in the city of Calgary.
3. Using the data sets provided, describe solutions to incentivize centralized dispatch systems or data platforms for for-hire ground transportation services and transportation network companies (TNCs).
4. Describe a plan to implement connected & automated vehicle testing, in a safe manner that can test mobility service delivery in an automated and connected city (i.e., shared mobility, resiliency, data platforms).
5. Describe how using a form of inter-modal integration and technology-based solutions can help enhance wheelchair accessible transportation service delivery and efficiency, including but not limited to shared mobility, mobility as a service, autonomous and connected mobility.
6. Create a proposal to increase shared mobility options, and multi-modal connections.
7. Create a solution that would encourage public & private wheelchair accessible or paratransit service enhancements.
8. Create a solution that would encourage taxis, livery or for-hire vehicles and TNCs to provide services to under-served communities.
